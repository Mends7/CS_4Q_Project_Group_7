 <p> Our project aims to bring awareness to mental health, especially the mental health of adolescences such as us. Anywhere, there is someone suffering quietly. Anytime, there may be someone attempting suicide. This campaign was created in regards to those people, we hope to bring awareness to the suffering of everyone and hopefully prevent extreme cases such as suicide. As cases such as suicide can be easily prevented with assurance and positivity, our project lives to fulfill that very purpose. We believe that all people really need is a little positivity to keep them going throughout the day, the week, and even their whole lives as cases such.</p>
